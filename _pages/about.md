# About me

<div style="text-align: justify"> My research interests span the fields of financial economics and game theory. 
In finance, my current research includes topics related to corporate finance; asset pricing; corporate governance; 
banking and risk management; quantitative finance; bankruptcy; fat tails and power laws; central bank 
communication; as well as text analysis. I also work in the field of theoretical economics, especially in 
contract theory, mechanism design, principal-agent problems and industrial organization. Of late, 
I have also become interested in political economy, development economics and economic history. </div> <br/>
